                Network management of encrypted traffic
          draft-smith-saag-encrypted-traffic-management-latest

Abstract

   Encrypted Internet traffic may pose traffic management challenges to
   network operators.  This document recommends approaches to help
   manage encrypted traffic, without breaching user privacy or security.

1.  Introduction

   Networks utilise various management techniques to ensure efficient
   throughput, congestion management, anti-SPAM and security measures.
   Historically these functions have utilised visibility of the Internet
   application layer.

   This visibility is rapidly diminishing - encrypted Internet traffic
   is expected to continue its upward trend, driven by increased privacy
   awareness, uptake by major players and advocacy from the [IAB],
   [RFC7258] and W3C [TAG].

   [IAB], [RFC7258] and [mm-effect-encrypt] recognise that network
   management functions are impacted by encryption, and that solutions
   are needed to persist them - as long as they do not threaten privacy.
   Such solutions would ensure the benefits of encryption do not degrade
   network efficiency.

1.1.  Document conventions

   This document describes the technical details of existing options to
   persist network management functions for encrypted traffic.  These
   options are categorised into two main sections: first, where
   encryption is used between the content server and client, and second,
   where browser proxies tunnel 'http' URIs over TLS.

   Finally a summary is provided of ongoing IETF work which is
   investigating how middleboxes along the path can improve encrypted
   traffic delivery.

   'Mitigation' is used throughout this document, and refers to a method
   of fully or partially supporting a particular network management
   function when traffic is encrypted.  This term is not meant to imply
   a removal or workaround of encryption.
